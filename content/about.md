   <p>Hello! This is Shiyu Dong, currently a Master's student in <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/masters/sociology-and-social-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sociology and Social Research at Utrecht University</a>. My research focuses on AI experiments in sociology and Agent-based Modeling, exploring how technology shapes social dynamics. My thesis supervisor is <a href="https://www.uu.nl/staff/JOu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Jiamin Ou</a>. I am currently a research intern at the <a href="https://odissei-soda.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ODISSEI SoDa Team</a>, working on projects related to LLMs and supervised by <a href="https://www.uu.nl/staff/QFang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Qixiang Fang</a>. Before my studies, I spent five years working in data analysis for the banking sector, building expertise in finance and lending in China. In my most recent role as a product manager, I designed an AI-generated content chatbot for market sales data, leveraging data-driven decision-making to optimize business strategies. My technical skills include R, Stata, Python, SQL, Figma, Excel, PowerPoint, Xmind, and Visio, which I have applied in both academic and professional settings. I also have experience working with large language models. I am very fond of pets and have two cats and a dog who currently live with my family in China. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, running, and hiking. Completing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pacific Crest Trail</a> is my life goal. Please feel free to contact me at: <a href="mailto:s.dong@students.uu.nl">s.dong@students.uu.nl</a> ðŸ“©</p>
